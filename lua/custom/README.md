# About Project
This project is simply some cherry-picked plugins config that works fine with my current workflow. And it works with `NvChad`

# Installation
- Get your device basic [`NvChad`](https://nvchad.com/docs/quickstart/install)
- Now go the directory named `lua/custom`, create one if doesn't exists
- Finally clone all *files/directories* of this project directly into `lua/custom/`
- Restart your `nvim`
- Use `:MasonInstallAll` to fetch all the dependencies
